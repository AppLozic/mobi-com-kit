<br><big><strong>Security</strong></big><p>The information that the App collects may be stored locally on your Device and may be transmitted to our servers in countries of the European Union (“EU”), the United States (“U.S.”), and/or other countries where Azuga, its affiliates or any of their service providers operate. The transmission of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure. Azuga uses many tools to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, we do not guarantee that your personal information or private communications will always remain private when using the App.</p>

<br><big><strong>Grant of license</strong></big><p>Azuga grants to you a non-transferable, non-exclusive and revocable license to install one copy of the App on your Device and use the App according to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The App is licensed, not sold, to you. Except as expressly granted by this Agreement or otherwise by Azuga or its licensors in writing, you acquire no right, title or license in the App or any data, software, content, application or materials accessed from or incorporated in the App. This Agreement does not give you any rights to any updates or upgrades to the App or to any maintenance releases, patches, fixes, extensions or enhancements (collectively, “Updates”) to the App developed by Azuga or its suppliers or licensors at any time in the future. Except as required under applicable law, this license does not entitle you to receive any maintenance or support services with respect to the App. Azuga may provide Updates and/or support. If provided by Azuga, Updates may be delivered automatically or you may be notified when a new Update is ready to be installed, or we make such Updates available for download. You authorize Azuga to deliver automatically any Update if we believe it is necessary to provide for the continued functionality of the App or for any reasonable business purpose. Your use of the Updates will be governed by this Agreement unless you are asked to agree to new or additional terms at the time of download or installation. You also agree that you may have to enter into a renewed version of this Agreement if you want to download, install or use a new or modified version of the App.</p>

<br><big><strong>Term and termination</strong></big><p>The license is effective for an indefinite period of time, until Azuga terminates it, or until you provide notice to Azuga of your decision to terminate it. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice to you if you fail to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement. Azuga reserves the right to suspend, discontinue, enhance, update or otherwise modify the App, or its availability to you, at any time without notice. Upon termination of the license to the App, you will cease all use of the App.</p>
<br><big><strong>Warranty</strong></big><p>Service Providers have no warranty obligation hereunder and give no guarantees with respect to the App or in relation to the sale, distribution or use thereof. Any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to Azuga’s warranty will be Azuga’s sole responsibility.
